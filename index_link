    <h1>Echoes of Displacement</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      <strong>Echoes of Displacement</strong> is a sound-based project that looks at how human-made noise affects natural environments. I focused on the growing presence of machine sounds—like cars and distant engines—even in protected areas that are meant to be quiet and undisturbed. All recordings were made in a nature reserve in the Orlické Mountains using a piezo microphone, which I attached to leaves and branches to capture sound vibrations from a non-human perspective. The goal was to highlight how much human activity has become part of these landscapes, even when it’s not immediately visible, and to draw attention to the loss of purely natural soundscapes.
